				<h2> For my presentation, I chose to share about my trip to Mexico this summer! There were 16 of us including my family, cousins, and a few friends. We flew to Puerto Vallarta, when we landed all 16 of us squeezed inside a mini van including everyone's luggage. We stayed at a resort for a week, in those days, we did so much, such as swimming, playing soccer on the beach, and of course eating! Although the hotel offered many actitvities, we explored the city a few times. A little town and market called Sayulita was one of the cites we visited.  My cousins, and my sister and I had the opportunity to zipline across the jungle and mountians, that just so happened to be near the ocean. This vacation is something I will never forget!   </h2>
